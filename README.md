A robust **date dimension (`dim_date`) table** is the backbone of any good Power BI data model.  
Without it, time-based analysis (YoY growth, fiscal reporting, seasonality trends, etc.) becomes messy and inconsistent.  

This guide documents, step by step, how to create one from scratch using **Power Query** and extend it with **Fiscal Year, Months, and Quarters** in the **Data Model**.

---

## 🚀 Steps in Power Query

### 🔹 Step 1: Create a Blank Query
- Inside Power Query → Right-click on Queries (left panel) → **New Query → Other Sources → Blank Query**  
- Rename the query to `dim_date`.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Generate a Continuous Date List
Enter this formula in the formula bar:

```powerquery
= { Number.From(#date(2018, 9, 1)) .. Number.From(#date(2021, 8, 1)) }
````

💡 **Tip:** Instead of hardcoding start & end dates, you can dynamically fetch them from your fact table:

```powerquery
= { Number.From( Date.StartOfMonth( List.Min( fact_sales_monthly[date] ) ) ) 
.. Number.From( Date.EndOfMonth( List.Max( fact_sales_monthly[date] ) ) ) }
```

This creates a continuous list of dates covering your entire dataset.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Convert List → Table

* Right-click the list header → **To Table**
* Rename the column to `Date`
* Change the data type to **Date**.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Add Month Start Column

`Add Column → Date → Month → Start of Month`
Rename to **Month**.

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Add Year Column

`Add Column → Date → Year → Year`
Rename to **Year**.

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Add Fiscal Month Column

👉 **What is a Fiscal Year (FY)?**
A **Fiscal Year** is a one-year period that companies use for financial reporting, often different from the calendar year.
For example, a fiscal year may start in **April** and end in **March**.

Now add a new **Custom Column**:

```powerquery
= Date.AddMonths([Month], 4)
```

Rename it to **FY Month**.

---

### 🔹 Step 7: Add Fiscal Year Column

Another **Custom Column**:

```powerquery
= Date.Year([FY Month])
```

Rename it to **FY Year**.

---

### 🔹 Step 8: Clean Up

Remove the intermediate **FY Month** column (optional).

Your `dim_date` table is now ready to be loaded into the data model.

---

### 🔹 Step 9: Connect to Data Model

Drag `dim_date[Date]` → `fact_sales_monthly[Date]` to build a relationship.
This ensures consistent time intelligence across reports.

---

##  Enhancements in the Data Model (DAX)

Now let’s add **Months** and **Quarters** inside the data model using DAX.
Go to `Power Pivot → Manage → Data View`

---

### 🔹 Month Abbreviation (MMM)

```DAX
MMM = FORMAT( dim_date[Date], "MMM" )
```

👉 This converts full month names into **3-letter abbreviations** (e.g., *Jan, Feb, Mar*).

---

### 🔹 Fiscal Month Number

```DAX
FY Month No = MONTH( DATE( YEAR( dim_date[Date] ), MONTH( dim_date[Date] ) + 4, 1 ) )
```

* If Fiscal Year starts in **September**, then:

  * September → 1
  * October → 2, and so on.

---

### 🔹 Fiscal Quarter

👉 **What is a Quarter?**
A **Quarter** is a three-month period in a fiscal year, commonly used for financial results (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4).

Formula:

```DAX
Quarter = "Q" & ROUNDUP( dim_date[FY Month No] / 3, 0 )
```

---

## ✅ Final Notes

With this `dim_date` table, you now have:

* Continuous Date Ranges
* Standard Calendar (Year, Month)
* Fiscal Year / Fiscal Month
* Quarters (aligned with Fiscal Year)

This makes your Power BI models **enterprise-ready**, supporting time intelligence and advanced analytics.
